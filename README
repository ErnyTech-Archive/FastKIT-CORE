============

FastKIT CORE is an advanced library that allows you to conveniently call the ADB and FASTBOOT commands in any software that allows the linking of Java libraries.

FastKIT CORE is developed directly by the FastKIT Toolkit Team for FastKIT, however it can be used for any software that needs an ADB or FASTBOOT bridge.

The library includes the ability to execute asynchronous ADB or FASTBOOT commands by creating a thread and is completely safe, any exception is captured and managed.
